Flask is a Python web framework that provides tools, libraries, and technologies for building web applications:

Lightweight
    Flask is a microframework that's simple and manageable, with only the essential components for web development.

Extensible
    Flask is designed to be highly customizable, with extensions that can add application features.

Scalable
    Flask can scale up to complex applications.

Accessible
    Flask is more accessible for new developers because you can build a web application quickly using only a single Python file.

Flask is a good choice for:
    Building a flexible and scalable web platform for clients to book and pay for rides or deliveries
    Building interactive data visualization apps and dashboards

Here are some other features of Flask:
    It's a WSGI framework, which stands for Web Server Gateway Interface.
    It relies on the Jinja2 template engine.
    It's an out-of-the-box framework, meaning you can jump straight into it.

The creator of Flask, Armin Ronacher, originally meant it to be an April Fool's joke. However, he realized that what he had been joking about could actually make it as a proper framework to build web applications.
